Ques- Explain the concept of linked lists and their applications in algorithm design.

A linked list is a fundamental data structure used in computer science and algorithm design. Unlike arrays, which store elements in contiguous memory locations, a linked list is composed of nodes, where each node contains two parts:
1- Data – the actual value stored.
2- Pointer (or reference) – a link to the next node in the sequence.

Types of Linked Lists
Singly Linked List: Each node points to the next node in the list.
Doubly Linked List: Each node points to both the next and the previous nodes.
Circular Linked List: The last node points back to the first node, forming a circle. This can be singly or doubly linked.

Application
Dynamic Memory Allocation.
Implementing Other Data Structures.
Efficient Insertions/Deletions.
